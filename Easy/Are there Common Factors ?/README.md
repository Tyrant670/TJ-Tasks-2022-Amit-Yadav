## Problem Name : 'Are there common factors?':

### Approach (Brute Force):

In this problem we've given 2 numbers a and b and we've to 
output the total number of common factors of a and b.

So basically the approach that i used here is, the maximum number
that can be a common factor is min(a,b), So I iterate through 0 to
min(a,b) and checking for each number that divides both a and b
and I cnt each of them.

The constraints are low so,

The time complexity is O(N).
