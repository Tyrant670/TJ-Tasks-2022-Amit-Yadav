### Approach (Brute Force):

We have given one number of digit consisting only 6 and 9 and
we have to return the maximum num by changing its only one digit from
6 to 9 or 9 to 6.

So basically we already know that we only need to change 
first comming 6 into 9 when we iterating through the number 
from its first digit to last,

First I convert the number into string and then iterating through
all the digits and checking if there is any 6 then i change it to 9 and 
break(comes out of the loop).


The time complexity is O(N).
