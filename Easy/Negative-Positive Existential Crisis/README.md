## Problem Name : 'Negative-Positive Existential Crisis':

### Approach :

Here we have to check if some number is exist in both form Negative
as well as Positive form in the array , the maximum number we
have to output.

I've taken two boolean array Pos and Neg and Iterating through all the 
the elements in the array and making true in pos and neg of that element
which exist in given array,
Finally I iterate from 0 to size-1 to check in pos and neg array
if for the same index both value in pos and neg should be true.

That's how I output the maximum elements in the array.

Becoz the constraints are low ,


The time complexity is O(N).
